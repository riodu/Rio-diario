>> Switzerland’s weather in January is dominated by cold temperatures and snowfall.

- ### The best months to ski in Switzerland are December, January, and February with **January would be the best month** to ski in Switzerland of all three.
	- Most tourists who intend to ski tend to visit **between Christmas and New Year**. Lots of locals go skiing during this period as well.
	- **January** is the best month to ski in my opinion. Snow conditions are often good, there are fewer crowds and hotel prices are not as high.
	- During **February**, it is common for locals to take ski vacations. If you go during this time, expect more crowds and higher hotel prices.
